# AI Insurance Agent Bot

This is an AI-powered Insurance Agent bot designed to assist users with insurance-related queries using IndiaFirst Life Insurance documents. The bot uses OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo model for query generation and response generation, along with ThirdAI's NeuralDB for fast document retrieval and Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF) for ranking search results.

## Features

- Provides accurate answers to user queries by retrieving information from insurance documents.
- Uses Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF) to combine and rank search results.
- Generates concise answers based on retrieved documents.
- Interactive chatbot UI using Streamlit.

## Technology Stack

- **Streamlit**: For the front-end interface.
- **OpenAI API**: For query generation and answering.
- **ThirdAI's NeuralDB**: For document storage and retrieval.
- **Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF)**: For search result ranking.
- **Python**: Main programming language.
  
## Project Structure

- `neuraldb_rrf.py`: Contains document insertion, search, and RRF functions.
- `main.py`: The main logic for generating outputs and managing bot interactions.
- `app.py`: Streamlit-based front-end chatbot interface.
- `.env`: Stores environment variables (API keys). **Do not upload this file to GitHub.**
- `requirements.txt`: List of dependencies.
- `.gitignore`: Specifies which files to exclude from version control.

## Getting Started
